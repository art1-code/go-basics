# Go Basics Learning Repository

This repository contains my journey learning Go (Golang) through practical examples and exercises.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different chapters/concepts:

- `c1-fc/` - First contact with Go

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical learning ground for Go programming concepts. Each directory contains specific examples and exercises that help in understanding different aspects of the language.

## Getting Started

To run these examples, you need to:

1. Install Go on your machine from [golang.org](https://golang.org)
2. Clone this repository
